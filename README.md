# transit
This repository contains a collection Python tools developed to
analyze transiting exoplanet light and radial velocity curves.
This code was used in fitting the discovery observations of the
planet [GJ1132b](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature15762). It has
not been particularly neatly packaged or comment for public use,
but please feel free to glean whatever you can from it.
